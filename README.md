# bun-decompile

Extracts the original transpiled sources from an executable produced by
`bun build --compile`.

This is a maintained fork of [lafkpages/bun-decompile](https://github.com/lafkpages/bun-decompile),
which did the original reverse-engineering of Bun's standalone module graph. See
[Credits](#credits).

## What it supports

Every Bun binary layout from v0.6.0 through v1.4.x, across all three desktop
platforms. Bun embeds the compiled payload differently depending on version and
target; the extractor detects the container by sniffing magic bytes and
dispatches accordingly, so you don't need to tell it which one you have.

| Platform | Container                    | Since        |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| macOS    | Mach-O `__BUN/__bun` section | all versions |
| Linux    | ELF `.bun` section           | ~1.3.10+     |
| Windows  | PE `.bun` section            | ~1.3.9+      |
| any      | appended-to-EOF (legacy)     | ≲ 1.2.x      |

Four on-disk metadata formats are handled (V1 through V4), spanning the
0.6.0-era layout through the 32-byte offset struct introduced in 1.3.0. Bun
1.4.0 is supported, including its
[reworked version banner](#a-note-on-bun-140) — extraction itself never depends
on the version string.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g @andrewgross/bun-decompile
```

Or with Bun:

```sh
bun add -g @andrewgross/bun-decompile
```

Or run it without installing:

```sh
bunx @andrewgross/bun-decompile <binary>
npx @andrewgross/bun-decompile <binary>
```

The CLI runs on Node 18+ and on Bun. You do **not** need Bun installed to
extract a Bun binary.

## Usage

```sh
bun-decompile <input-binary> [options]
```

The installed command is `bun-decompile` (shorter than the scoped package name).

```console
$ bun-decompile ./my-app -o ./extracted
Bun v1.3.9 (cf6cdbbb)
Extracted 4 file(s) to ./extracted

$ ls ./extracted
index.js  index.js.map  logo-47vhjydn.png  data-twdsv7gz.bin
```

The first line reports the Bun version the binary was built with. It is
informational: if the version can't be read, the CLI warns and still extracts
(see [A note on Bun 1.4.0](#a-note-on-bun-140)). The entrypoint is written as
`index.js` unless `--no-normalize` is passed, and other bundled assets keep the
hashed names Bun gave them. Any error is fatal and exits non-zero rather than
writing partial output.

### Options

| Flag                 | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `-o, --output <dir>` | Output directory (default: `./decompiled`)        |
| `--no-normalize`     | Don't normalize entrypoint filename to `index.js` |
| `-v, --version`      | Print version and exit                            |
| `-h, --help`         | Print help and exit                               |

### Examples

Extract into a directory of your choosing:

```sh
bun-decompile ./my-app -o ./extracted
```

Keep the entrypoint's original bundled filename instead of renaming it to
`index.js`:

```sh
bun-decompile ./my-app --no-normalize
```

Inline sourcemaps, when present, are written alongside each file as `<file>.map`.

## Library usage

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

import { extractBundledFiles, getExecutableVersion } from "@andrewgross/bun-decompile";

const binary = await readFile("./my-app");

const { version, revision } = getExecutableVersion(binary);
const files = extractBundledFiles(binary);

for (const file of files) {
  console.log(file.path, file.contents.byteLength);
}
```

Both entry points accept a `Buffer`, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer`, or `DataView`
(`BinaryInput`). Views are read using their own `byteOffset`/`byteLength`, so a
pooled or sliced `Buffer` works correctly.

The library itself is runtime-agnostic — it touches no Node or Bun APIs and
operates purely on `DataView`, so it runs unchanged in the browser.

### API

| Export                 | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `extractBundledFiles`  | Returns `BundledFile[]` — `{ path, contents, sourcemap? }`         |
| `getExecutableVersion` | Returns `{ version, revision }` read from the embedded Bun runtime |
| `removeLeadingSlash`   | Path helper                                                        |

Structural problems raise a subclass of `InvalidExecutableError`
(`InvalidTrailerError`, `TotalByteCountMismatchError`, `VersionNotFoundError`)
rather than returning partial or corrupt data.

### A note on Bun 1.4.0

Bun 1.4.0 stopped embedding a literal version string after its ANSI
`bun build v` marker — it became a runtime-substituted placeholder — which
breaks naive version detection. This fork falls back to scanning the runtime's
`Bun v<version>` banner.

Version detection is informational only. `extractBundledFiles` is driven
entirely by the binary's struct layout, so a future Bun release that changes the
banner again will still extract; the CLI degrades to a warning rather than
failing.

## Development

```sh
bun install
```

| Script                   | Description                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run build`          | Compile to `dist/` (JS + type declarations)   |
| `bun test`               | Unit tests                                    |
| `bun run test:e2e`       | End-to-end tests against real Bun releases    |
| `bun run typecheck`      | Typecheck without emitting                    |
| `bun run lint`           | Prettier check                                |
| `bun run build-fixtures` | Regenerate unit-test fixtures                 |
| `bun run debug-binary`   | Inspect a binary's container, format, offsets |

### Unit tests

Build the dummy test binary first, then run the suite:

```sh
bun build --compile --sourcemap=inline src/lib/tests/dummy/index.ts --outfile src/lib/tests/dummy/dummy
DUMMY_VERSION=$(bun --version) bun test
```

### E2E tests

Compiles a dummy binary with Bun v1.1.0, v1.1.26, v1.2.4, and v1.3.9 — one per
metadata format revision — and extracts each with the CLI. Then uses v1.3.14 to
cross-compile `bun-linux-x64` and `bun-windows-x64` targets, exercising ELF and
PE section extraction.

```sh
bun run test:e2e
```

Downloaded Bun versions are cached under `~/.cache/bun-decompile/`.

## Credits

Originally created by [LuisAFK (@lafkpages)](https://github.com/lafkpages) as
[bun-decompile](https://github.com/lafkpages/bun-decompile). The original
project worked out how Bun's standalone module graph is laid out and how to walk
it — the foundation everything here is built on.

This fork adds:

- Linux (ELF) and Windows (PE) `.bun` section support
- V3 and V4 metadata formats (Bun 1.2.4+ and 1.3.0+)
- Bun 1.4.0 version-banner detection, and non-fatal version detection
- A refactor into a container-detection pipeline, plus a Node-compatible CLI
